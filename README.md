# Charity Site

## Description

This project is a non-profit eCommerce platform designed to support people in need. Unlike traditional online stores, when a customer makes a purchase, the product is not delivered to them but sent directly to a charitable organization in Lyon. The producer ships the item, and the organization is responsible for distributing it to those in need.
